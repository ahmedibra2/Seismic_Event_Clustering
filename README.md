Instructions

Use jupyter notebook file "Clustering_All_Events_Time.ipynb" to generate and save seimic clusters.

Use jupyter notebook file "Fitting_Algorithm.ipynb" to fit fault planes through the generated clusters using least squres minimization.

Use jupyter notebook file "Computing_Fault_Planes_from_known_Focal_Mechanisms.ipynb" to interpolate, compute, and subcluster new fault planes and focal mechanisms based on known focal mechanisms in the region.

See powerpoint slides for results.
